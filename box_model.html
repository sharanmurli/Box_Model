	  <p>A kaleidoscopic blend of Indian and Portuguese cultures, sweetened with sun, sea, sand, seafood,
	  susegad and spirituality, Goa is India's pocket-sized paradise.</p>
	  <h4>Beach Bounty</h4>
	  <p>Goa’s biggest draw is undoubtedly its virtually uninterrupted string of golden-sand beaches. </p>

      <h2><center>ANJUNA MARKET</center></h2>
	  <img style="width: 260px;height: 160px;"src="images/anjuna.jpg" alt="pic1">
	  <p>Whether you’re in the market for some serious souvenirs or simply looking for an injection of local life,
	  Goa’s many markets are a must. The most famous is Anjuna's flea market, held every Wednesday in season since the 1970s.
	  It's a curious blend of traders and stalls from all
	  over India, backpackers, day trippers and the odd dreadlocked hippie, but it's not to be missed. </p>

      <h2><center>DHUDSAGAR FALLS</center></h2>
	  <img style="width: 260px;height: 160px;" src="images/dhudsagar.jpg" alt="pic1">
	  <p>Waterfall in Molem Region
Situated in the far southeastern corner of the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary, Goa’s most impressive waterfall
splashes down just west of the border with Karnataka state. At 603m this is the second highest in India, after Jog Falls.
The falls are best visited as soon after monsoon as possible (October is perfect), when the water
levels are highest and the cascades earn their misty nomenclature, Dudhsagar, meaning ‘Sea of Milk' in Konkani.</p>

	 <div class="attractions fonts_style">
      <h2><center>PANJIM</center></h2>
	  <img style="width: 260px;height: 160px;" src="images/panaji.jpg" alt="pic1">
	  <p>Slung along the banks of the broad Mandovi River, Panaji is an easygoing city with the delightful old
	  Portuguese districts of Fontainhas and Sao Tomé the perfect setting for a lazy afternoon of wandering. Sip
	  firewater feni with locals in a hole-in-the-wall bar, gamble the night away on a floating luxury casino,
	  clamber up to the wedding-cake-white Church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception or poke
	  about in boutiques and book shops. </p>

    </div>
	 <div class="attractions fonts_style">
      <h2><center>PALOLEM BEACH</center></h2>
	  <img style="width: 260px;height: 160px;" src="images/palolem.jpg" alt="pic1">
	  <p>A blissful crescent of golden sand, balmy seas, gently swaying palm trees,
	  good food, beach huts galore and a colourful backpacker-oriented beach bar scene make
	  Palolem a favourite with travellers from across the globe. Though some say it’s too crowded in season,
	  there are few better all-round beaches in Goa for yoga, kayaking, swimming or just lazing in your beachfront hammock,
	  and the quieter beaches of Patnem and Agonda are just a short ride away.
